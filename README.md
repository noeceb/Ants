<h3> Introduction </h3>
In this project, you will create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Chapter 2.5 of Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

<h3> The Game </h3>
A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed to defend their colony. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. Bees either try to move toward the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. Ants perform a different action depending on their type, such as collecting more food, or throwing leaves at the bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee fleet has been vanquished (you win).
